 I'm Juan García

C++ Software Developer focused on GPU programming, high-performance computing, rendering, and low-level systems engineering.
I work across the stack — from SYCL kernels and CUDA path tracers to PBR rendering and engine-level architecture.
My background blends mathematics, numerical methods, parallel computing, and graphics.

Since 2017, I’ve been building tools, engines, and compute systems that push performance while staying modern and clean.

🚀 Featured Projects

🔷 FunGT  
A C++ graphics/compute engine that integrates OpenGL rasterization, CUDA path-tracing, SYCL kernels, PBR materials, model loading (Assimp), physics utilities, and scene management.  
A long-term serious project where I explore real-time and offline rendering pipelines under one framework.

🔷 SYCL-Metal Backend Prototype  
An experimental prototype where I work on enabling SYCL to target Apple's Metal shading language.  
The project involves converting SPIR-V → MSL, building a minimal device runtime, and exploring what a real SYCL backend for Metal would require.  
This includes integrating SPIRV-Cross, testing kernel translation, and designing a backend flow similar to CUDA/HIP targets.
